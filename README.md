Having problems with theSuffocater? Read this article:

    === Init Systems ===
        - This build uses sysvinit initialization system. If you use systemd,
          try 'the-suffocater-legacy'. Unfortunately we dont have openrc build yet.
        
    === Notes for BSD users ===
        - *NetBSD*: Ensure that pkgin is installed on NetBSD before running the script. If itâ€™s not
          available, you may need to install it using the default package manager.
        - *OpenBSD*: Ensure the necessary packages are available; pfctl is typically included,
          but you might want to double-check if you need fail2ban.
    
    === Common problems with modules ===
        - Check if "modules" directory exists && Check if "modules" directory has any .py files.
        - Reinstall theSuffocater from GitHub. Maybe you just have a broken install.
        - Dont change any configurations files and directories unless you know what you are doing.
