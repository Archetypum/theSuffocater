## theSuffocater v1.0.0-stable:

This is the very first stable release of theSuffocater.
Features CLI and GUI stable versions of the carcass, 11 working modules and 4 scripts.
Code can be very strange, messy, buggy and even unfinished, but we promise to fix
everything in next stable releases.

Nothing left to say here anymore, its just first stable release.
